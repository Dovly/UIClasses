Mongodb - is a cross platform document oriented database program. Mongodb is been classified as NOSQL database program,MongoDB is developed and maintained by MongoDB INC. Organization.

MongoDB  is cross-platform, document oriented opensource DBMS (Database Management System). It provides high availability, high performance, and easly scalable.

While interacting with mongodb, we wont be writing ay SQL queries, instead we use commands.

Features of MongoDB :
1. Mongodb Commands uses a master-slave replcation concept, which prevent database downtime, this replica feature is proved to be a very importent feature of Mongo.

2. MongoDB can run over multiple servers, hence data is duplicated over multiple servers. Which helps to preserver data incase of hardware failure.

3. Data in MongoDB is schema-less, hence its more efficient.




Commands through which we can interact with DB:

db - Returns the current database in use

use <dbname> - Creates the database if its not there, if its there, makes it as current database.

show collections - Returns all the collection within the current db

db.<collectionname>.insert({<json object>}) - Used to insert a document in a collection

db.collectionName.find() - Returns all the documents within the collection.

db.collectionName.find().limit(10) - Returns top 10  documents within the collection.

db.<collectionname>.insertOne({<json object>}) - Used to insert a single document in a collection

db.<collectionname>.insertMany(<Array of json object>) - Used to insert a multiple document to a collection.

etc.
