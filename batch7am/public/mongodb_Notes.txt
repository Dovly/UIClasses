MongoDB  is cross-platform, document oriented opensource DBMS (Database Management System). It provides high availability, high performance, and easly scalable.

While interacting with mongodb, we wont be writing ay SQL queries, instead we use commands.

Features of MongoDB :
1. Mongodb Commands uses a master-slave replcation concept, which prevent database downtime, this replica feature is proved to be a very importent feature of Mongo.

2. MongoDB can run over multiple servers, hence data is duplicated over multiple servers. Which helps to preserver data incase of hardware failure.

3. Data in MongoDB is schema-less, hence its more efficient.
